title: GSoC Project Ideas
---

Below, you can find some ideas on the directions in which we could push Polypheny together. Please consider them as starting points for your proposal. Of course, if you have other ideas, we would be very happy to hear them. Feel free to [contact us](/community/gsoc/#contact) and get feedback on what you plan to do beforehand.

Simply copying and pasting one of the ideas will not work. On the other hand, creating a completely new idea without first [consulting](/community/gsoc/#contact) the mentors wonâ€™t work as well.

## Query the blockchain
A blockchain can be seen as a distributed append-only database. The aim of this project is to build an adapter for executing (read) queries against (different) blockchains like the Bitcoin blockchain or the Ethereum blockchain.

Due to Polypheny's ability to join and combine data from different adapters in one query, this project will allow to integrate the latest data from a blockchain into arbitrary queries. 

**Difficulty**: medium-hard



## Quality check and assurance
A major problem in the process of developing any kind of software is to ensure that a change does not introduce any bugs in a completely different subsystem of the software. For a database system this also includes to ensure the completeness and correctness of the results of a query.

Continuously and automatically checking that a system behaves and works like expected is therefore important to ensure consistent software quality and to avoid regressions. Usually, this is done using unit tests and integration tests. While unit tests check that individual parts (units) of the code (typically individual methods) work as expected, integration testing checks if the whole application works correctly.

Currently, Polypheny has only a few integration tests which make it hard to avoid regressions and unintended side effects. The aim of this project idea is to systematically add additional tests to cover as many features as possible. This especially means writing checks for the SQL query interface.

**Difficulty**: easy



##  Visualize it
In debugging mode, Polypheny creates a lot of log output on all decisions and optimizations taken while processing a query. This output is hard to read but contains a lot of useful and interesting information for developing and optimizing Polypheny. 

The idea of this project is to visualize this debugging information in the UI. This allows to easily review the whole query processing and find errors. 

**Difficulty**: medium-easy



## Support for Contextual Query Language
The _Contextual Query Language (CQL)_ is a formal language for representing queries to information retrieval systems such as search engines, bibliographic catalogs and museum collection information. The idea of this project is to add a read-only CQL query interface to Polypheny-DB. 

**Difficulty**: medium



## RESTful query interface 
RESTful APIs are programming interfaces that accept HTTP _GET_, _PUT_, _POST_ and _DELETE_ requests. REST interactions are always stateless.

The aim of this project is to add a RESTful query interface for Polypheny. The idea is not to wrap a SQL query into a get request but to express the query in a "REST-style". A query could look like that: `GET /schema/table/filter1/filter2/`

A proposal for this project should contain a concept on how read and write queries would look like.

**Difficulty**: medium



## Keep them all     
A multi-version database system allows to store multiple versions of the same entry. This allows, for example, in a human resources database to not only query the current salary of an employee, but also the salary he had two years ago.  

The goal of this project is to extend Polypheny-DB to transparently support storing multiple versions of an element including a full referential integrity for the past revisions. 

The project includes
* extending Polypheny's SQL dialect to support specifying a version,
* rewriting the queries to retrieve the right version and to add a new version if the query aims to modify an existing entry, and
* evaluate the correctness of the system especially for complex queries.

**Difficulty**: hard



## Physical query plan builder
The Polypheny-UI already comes with a logical query plan builder integrated. The aim of this project is to implement a graphical build tool for physical query plans similar to the one for logical query plans. In the polystore context, the physical query plan distinguishes from the logical one by using operators specific to the involved data store adapters. 

A physical query plan builder would be extremely helpful for development. Because there is already an implementation for logical plans, parts of the code can be reused. 

To get an impression how a physical query plan in Polypheny looks like you can simply execute a query in the UI and have a look at the plan by selecting "Physical Query Plan" in the left menu.
