title:  JDBC Driver
---

Polypheny provides a JDBC driver that supports core JDBC functionality. The JDBC driver must be installed in a 64-bit environment and requires Java 1.8 (or higher).

The driver can be used with most client tools/applications that support JDBC for connecting to a database server. [*Polypheny-Client*](https://github.com/polypheny/Polypheny-Client), the command line client provided by Polypheny, is an example of a JDBC-based application.

The driver establishes access to Polypheny-DBs via the *Avatica general purpose interface*.

For information about changes in the latest version of the JDBC Driver, see the
