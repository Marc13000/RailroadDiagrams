_Polypheny-DB_ is a self-adaptive Polystore that provides cost- and workload aware access to heterogeneous data. As a Polystore, Polypheny-DB seamlessly combines different underlying data storage engines to provide good query performance independent of the type of workload.

Polypheny-DB is a research system developed at the University of Basel, Switzerland. As a research system, Polypheny-DB is not intended to be used in a productive environment.
