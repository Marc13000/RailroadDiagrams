The easiest way to setup Polypheny-DB is to use our [latest release](https://github.com/polypheny/Polypheny-DB/releases/latest). On this page we describe how to deploy Polypheny-DB on different operating systems using these releases. It is of course also possible to [manually build](#) Polypheny-DB or to use [Polypheny Control](/documentation/Polypheny-Control/). However, this is not recommended for productive deployments.


## Prerequisites

See [this](/documentation/Stores/Docker/) on how to setup Docker to use the built-in Docker-based data store deployment.


## Binaries


### Windows


### macOS


### Linux


### Other




## Getting Started




## Data Folder
Polypheny-DB stores files in the local file system. By default, this is done in a special folder called `.polypheny` in the home directory of the executing user.
This location can be customized by setting a system environment variable called `POLYPHENY_HOME` pointing to the desired location before Polypheny-DB is started.
